# I downloaded fastq files from the following ftp server for the following citation:

# ftp://ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj_database/dra/fastq/DRA002/DRA002265/*

# The files downloaded were metadata files for the experiment/samples and fastq files. I'm a bit confused on the aliases used to name the files
# So I changed the file names to match the sample names

 # Code to relocate each file from individual
 # Wrote this code to display the alias and sample code for each fastq file
